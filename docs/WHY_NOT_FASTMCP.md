# Why We're Not Using FastMCP

## Question
"Why not use `FastMCP` from the MCP SDK? It looks much simpler with decorators!"

## Answer

You're right that `FastMCP` looks simpler, but **it's not compatible with our use case**. Here's why:

### What FastMCP Is Designed For

`FastMCP` from the official MCP SDK is designed for:

1. **stdio transport** - Command-line tools that communicate via standard input/output
2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** - Streaming server-sent events transport
3. **Its own server runtime** - Uses `mcp.run()` which starts its own server

### What Cursor Expects

Cursor expects:

1. **HTTP server** with standard request/response cycle
2. **JSON-RPC 2.0 at `POST /`** - Standard JSON-RPC protocol over HTTP
3. **FastAPI/standard HTTP endpoints** - For CRUD operations

### The Incompatibility

```python
# FastMCP way (doesn't work with Cursor's HTTP expectations)
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

@mcp.resource("resource:///{id}")
def get_resource(id: str) -> str:
    return "content"

# This runs its own server with stdio/SSE transport
mcp.run()  # ❌ Not HTTP JSON-RPC
```

```python
# Our way (works with Cursor)
from mcp.types import Resource  # Use SDK types
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/")  # HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint
async def handle_mcp(request):
    # Manual JSON-RPC handling
    # But use MCP SDK types for validation ✅
    resource = Resource(uri=..., name=..., ...)
```

### Our Hybrid Approach

We use the **best of both worlds**:

✅ **MCP SDK types** - For validation (Resource, Tool, Prompt, TextContent)
✅ **Manual JSON-RPC** - For HTTP compatibility with Cursor  
✅ **FastAPI** - For standard HTTP endpoints and CRUD operations

### Code Comparison

**If we used FastMCP (doesn't work):**
```python
mcp = FastMCP("server")

@mcp.resource("resource:///{id}")
def get_resource(id: str):
    return db.get_resource(id)

mcp.run()  # Starts stdio/SSE server ❌
```

**Our hybrid approach (works):**
```python
from mcp.types import Resource  # SDK type validation ✅

@app.post("/")
async def mcp_handler(request):
    if method == "resources/list":
        resources = db.get_all_resources()
        # Use MCP SDK for validation
        mcp_resources = [
            Resource(uri=..., name=..., ...)  # ✅ Type-safe
            for r in resources
        ]
        return jsonrpc_response(req_id, {
            "resources": [r.model_dump(mode='json') for r in mcp_resources]
        })
```

### When to Use FastMCP

Use `FastMCP` when:
- Building CLI tools (stdio transport)
- Using SSE streaming
- Don't need custom HTTP endpoints
- Simple MCP server without extra features

### When to Use Our Approach

Use our hybrid approach when:
- Need HTTP with JSON-RPC 2.0 (like Cursor)
- Want FastAPI for CRUD endpoints
- Need custom HTTP routes
- Integration with existing FastAPI app

## Summary

**FastMCP** = Simple but limited to stdio/SSE  
**Our approach** = MCP SDK types + manual JSON-RPC = HTTP compatibility ✅

This is the **correct pattern** for HTTP-based MCP servers that work with Cursor!
